# 🛡️ Wazuh SIEM Lab — Security Monitoring & Threat Detection

This repository documents my personal lab project using **Wazuh** as a SIEM solution. The goal is to build and configure a complete environment for **security event monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection**.

This lab helps reinforce key concepts in cybersecurity operations, integrating Wazuh with Elastic Stack (ELK) and deploying agents for endpoint visibility.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- ✅ Install and configure Wazuh Server and Agents in a lab environment.
- ✅ Integrate Wazuh with Elastic Stack (ELK) for log visualization and analysis.
- ✅ Simulate common attack scenarios to generate security events.
- ✅ Develop detection rules and analyze alerts using MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- ✅ Practice incident triage and threat hunting techniques with Wazuh.

## 📈 Why this Project?

As a network security engineer transitioning into cybersecurity, I am building this Wazuh SIEM lab to gain hands-on experience with **security event monitoring, log analysis, and incident response workflows**. This project complements my certifications and personal labs in threat detection and threat intelligence (ELK, TheHive, Cortex, MISP).
